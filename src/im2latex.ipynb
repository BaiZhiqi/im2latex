    "* Follows the [Show, Attend and Tell paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Show-Attend-and-Tell-Neural-Image-Caption-Generati-Xu-Ba/146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616)\n",
    "* [VGG ConvNet (16 or 19)](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/) without the top-3 layers\n",
    "    * Pre-initialized with the VGG weights but allowed to train\n",
    "    * The ConvNet outputs $D$ dimensional vectors in a WxH grid where W and H are 1/16th of the input image size (due to 4 max-pool layers). Defining $W.H \\equiv L$ the ConvNet output represents L locations of the image $i \\in [1,L]$ and correspondingly outputs to L annotation vectors $a_i$, each of size $D$.\n",
    "* A dense (FC) attention model: The deterministic soft-attention model of the paper computes $\\alpha_{t,i}$ which is used to select or blend the $a_i$ vectors before being fed as inputs to the decoder LSTM network (see below).\n",
    "    * Inputs to the attention model are $a_i$ and $h_{t-1}$ (previous hidden state of LSTM network - see below)\n",
    "    and $$\\alpha_{t,i} = softmax ( f_{att}(a_i, h_{t-1}) )$$\n",
    "* A Decoder model: A conditioned LSTM that outputs probabilities of the text tokens $y_t$ at each step. The LSTM is conditioned upon $z_t = \\sum_i^L(\\alpha_{t,i}.a_i)$ and takes the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ as input. In addition, an embedding of the previous output $Ey_{t-1}$ is also input to the LSTM. At training time, $y_{t-1}$ would be derived from the training samples, while at inferencing time it would be fed-back from the previous predicted word.\n",
    "    * $y$ is taken from a fixed vocabulary of K words. An embedding matrix $E$ is used to narrow its representation. The embedding weights $E$ are learnt end-to-end by the model as well.\n",
    "    * The decoder LSTM uses a deep layer between $h_t$ and $y_t$. It is called a deep output layer and is described in [section 3.2.2 of this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-to-Construct-Deep-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-Pascanu-G%C3%BCl%C3%A7ehre/533ee188324b833e059cb59b654e6160776d5812). That is:\n",
    "    $$ p(y_t) = Softmax \\Big( f_out(Ey_{t-1}, h_t, \\hat{z}_t) \\Big) $$\n",
    "* Initialization MLPs: Two MLPs are used to produce the initial memory-state of the LSTM as well as $h_{t-1}$ value. Each MLP takes in the entire image's features (i.e. average of $a_i$) as its input and is trained end-to-end.\n",
    "    $$ c_o = f_{init,c}\\Big( \\sum_i^L a_i \\Big) $$\n",
    "    $$ h_o = f_{init,h}\\Big( \\sum_i^L a_i \\Big) $$\n",
    "* Training:\n",
    "    * 3 models from above - all except the conv-net - are trained end-to-end using SGD\n",
    "    * The model is trained for a variable number of time steps - depending on each batch"

Therefore the shared weight matrix for all a_i has shape (D, D), while shape of a is (B, L, D) where is B=batch-size. Weight matrix of h_i is separate and has the expected shape (n, D). This sharing of weights across a_i is interesting.\n",

    "A Decoder model: A conditioned LSTM that outputs probabilities of the text tokens $y_t$ at each step. The LSTM is conditioned upon $z_t = \\sum_i^L(\\alpha_{t,i}.a_i)$ and takes the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ as input. In addition, an embedding of the previous output $Ey_{t-1}$ is also input to the LSTM. At training time, $y_{t-1}$ would be derived from the training samples, while at inferencing time it would be fed-back from the previous predicted word.\n",

It is called a deep output layer and is described in [section 3.2.2 of this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-to-Construct-Deep-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-Pascanu-G%C3%BCl%C3%A7ehre/533ee188324b833e059cb59b654e6160776d5812).

It turns out that for the original use-case of caption generation, the network would learn to emphasize objects by turning up the value of this scalar when it was focusing on objects. It is not clear at this time whether we'll need this feature for im2latex.\n"
