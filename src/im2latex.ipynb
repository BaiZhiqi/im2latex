    "* Follows the [Show, Attend and Tell paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Show-Attend-and-Tell-Neural-Image-Caption-Generati-Xu-Ba/146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616)\n",
    "* [VGG ConvNet (16 or 19)](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/) without the top-3 layers\n",
    "    * Pre-initialized with the VGG weights but allowed to train\n",
    "    * The ConvNet outputs $D$ dimensional vectors in a WxH grid where W and H are 1/16th of the input image size (due to 4 max-pool layers). Defining $W.H \\equiv L$ the ConvNet output represents L locations of the image $i \\in [1,L]$ and correspondingly outputs to L annotation vectors $a_i$, each of size $D$.\n",
    "* A dense (FC) attention model: The deterministic soft-attention model of the paper computes $\\alpha_{t,i}$ which is used to select or blend the $a_i$ vectors before being fed as inputs to the decoder LSTM network (see below).\n",
    "    * Inputs to the attention model are $a_i$ and $h_{t-1}$ (previous hidden state of LSTM network - see below)\n",
    "    and $$\\alpha_{t,i} = softmax ( f_{att}(a_i, h_{t-1}) )$$\n",
    "* A Decoder model: A conditioned LSTM that outputs probabilities of the text tokens $y_t$ at each step. The LSTM is conditioned upon $z_t = \\sum_i^L(\\alpha_{t,i}.a_i)$ and takes the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ as input. In addition, an embedding of the previous output $Ey_{t-1}$ is also input to the LSTM. At training time, $y_{t-1}$ would be derived from the training samples, while at inferencing time it would be fed-back from the previous predicted word.\n",
    "    * $y$ is taken from a fixed vocabulary of K words. An embedding matrix $E$ is used to narrow its representation. The embedding weights $E$ are learnt end-to-end by the model as well.\n",
    "    * The decoder LSTM uses a deep layer between $h_t$ and $y_t$. It is called a deep output layer and is described in [section 3.2.2 of this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-to-Construct-Deep-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-Pascanu-G%C3%BCl%C3%A7ehre/533ee188324b833e059cb59b654e6160776d5812). That is:\n",
    "    $$ p(y_t) = Softmax \\Big( f_out(Ey_{t-1}, h_t, \\hat{z}_t) \\Big) $$\n",
    "* Initialization MLPs: Two MLPs are used to produce the initial memory-state of the LSTM as well as $h_{t-1}$ value. Each MLP takes in the entire image's features (i.e. average of $a_i$) as its input and is trained end-to-end.\n",
    "    $$ c_o = f_{init,c}\\Big( \\sum_i^L a_i \\Big) $$\n",

    "#### Decoder Model\n",
    "A dense (FC) attention model: The deterministic soft-attention model of the paper computes $\\alpha_{t,i}$ which is used to select or blend the $a_i$ vectors before being fed as inputs to the decoder LSTM network (see below).\n",
    "* Inputs to the attention model are $a_i$ and $h_{t-1}$ (previous hidden state of LSTM network - see below) and $$\\alpha_{t,i} = softmax ( f_{att}(a_i, h_{t-1}) )$$\n",
    "* Note that the model $f_{att}$ shares weights across all values of a_i (i.e. for all i = 1-L). Therefore the shared weight matrix for all a_i has shape (D, D), while shape of a is (B, L, D) where is B=batch-size. Weight matrix of h_i is separate and has the expected shape (n, D). This sharing of weights across a_i is interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decoder model: A conditioned LSTM that outputs probabilities of the text tokens $y_t$ at each step. The LSTM is conditioned upon $z_t = \\sum_i^L(\\alpha_{t,i}.a_i)$ and takes the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ as input. In addition, an embedding of the previous output $Ey_{t-1}$ is also input to the LSTM. At training time, $y_{t-1}$ would be derived from the training samples, while at inferencing time it would be fed-back from the previous predicted word.\n",
    "* $y$ is taken from a fixed vocabulary of K words. An embedding matrix $E$ is used to narrow its representation. The embedding weights $E$ are learnt end-to-end by the model as well.\n",
    "* The decoder LSTM uses a deep layer between $h_t$ and $y_t$. It is called a deep output layer and is described in [section 3.2.2 of this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-to-Construct-Deep-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-Pascanu-G%C3%BCl%C3%A7ehre/533ee188324b833e059cb59b654e6160776d5812).
